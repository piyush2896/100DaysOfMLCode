# Introduction
* Today AI is a thriving field with manu practical applications and active research topics.
  - Automate Routine Labor
  - Understand Speech/Images
  - Make Diagnoses in medicine and
  - Support basic Scientific Research


* Early days of AI: Rapid solutions to problems (with formal rules) which were intellectually difficult for humans but comparticvel straightforward for computers!

|Challenge to AI| Solution Presented here|
|:---|:---|
|Solving tasks which are intuitively easy for humans!| Allow computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined through its relation to simpler concepts|

* This removes requirement of a human operator to give formal feedback and the computer can learn complicated concepts by building upon simpler one. A graph displaying this concept will be deep with many layers! This approach is called **Deep Learning**.
